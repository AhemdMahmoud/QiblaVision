# QiblaVision

### ✨ QiblaVision is an innovative AI-powered system that accurately detects and recognizes critical postures in the Islamic prayer ritual (Salat). Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the system identifies essential Salat postures such as Ruku (bowing), Raising, and Takbeer (standing), ensuring that users can perform their prayers precisely and confidently.



## 🎯 Purpose

### QiblaVision aims to blend technology with cultural heritage, creating meaningful innovations that respect and support religious practices. Whether you're a student learning Salat or looking to ensure your prayer postures align with tradition, SalatPose is designed to help you accurately and efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

Real-Time Detection: Utilizes cutting-edge neural network models, including Faster R-CNN and YOLO V8, to enable real-time, high-precision detection of Salat postures.
Enhanced Accuracy: Integrates the Mediapipe Pose model to capture the unique angles and positions that define each posture, improving recognition accuracy.
Educational Tool: Aims to serve as a valuable tool for educational purposes, helping users learn and perfect their prayer postures.

## 📚 How It Works

Pose Detection: The system first uses the YOLO V8 and Faster R-CNN models to identify the body posture.
Posture Recognition: The Mediapipe Pose model analyzes the detected pose to ensure it matches one of the fundamental Salat postures
